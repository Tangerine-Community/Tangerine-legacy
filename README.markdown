# Assess students with tablets or your phone

Tangerine is an application for assessing students on any scale, country-level, district-level or classroom-level. Tangerine is designed for [Early Grade Reading Assessments](https://www.eddataglobal.org/reading/) but flexible and powerful enough to handle any survey's requirements.

Alternatively put, Tangerine is a [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org/page/index) that uses 
[Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [LessCSS](http://lesscss.org/) written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) augmented with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and PHP.
